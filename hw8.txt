a. A+=AB
b. B+=B
c. (ACEG)+=ACEGBF
d.(BD)+=BDEGFAC
A. only on left side
B. CDA, BCD,ECD
C. "A->B" - A is not a super key, but it is part of a candidate key
"BC->E" -  BC is not a super key, but it is part of a candiadte key together
"ED->A" ED is not a super key, but they are part of a candidate key together
All functional dependicies are part of some candidate key so it is 3NF
d.
not a super key and does not appear trivial
